### Prerequisites

You need to have **Go** installed on your system.

### Build from source

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mu7ammad1951/task-tracker-cli 
    cd task-tracker-cli
    ```
2.  Build the executable:
    ```bash
    go build -o todo
    ```
3.  (Optional) Move the executable to a directory in your system's PATH to run it from anywhere (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/macOS):
    ```bash
    mv todo /usr/local/bin/
    ```

## üìù Usage

The main executable is assumed to be named `todo` (or the name you chose during the build, like `task-tracker-cli`).
